### 5.1.1 Vectors

1. Dot product
   1. [E] Whatâ€™s the geometric interpretation of the dot product of two vectors?
   ```text
   The dot product of two vectors can be interpreted geometrically as the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them. This can be written as: dot product = magnitude of vector 1 * magnitude of vector 2 * cos(angle between vectors). Geometrically, the dot product of two vectors tells us about the orientation of the vectors relative to each other. If the dot product is positive, it means the vectors are oriented in roughly the same direction. If the dot product is negative, it means the vectors are oriented in opposite directions. If the dot product is zero, it means the vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other. 
   
   The dot product has many useful properties and applications. For example, it can be used to find the projection of one vector onto another, to test whether two vectors are orthogonal, and to compute the angle between two vectors. It is also closely related to the cross product, which is a vector quantity that describes the direction and magnitude of the rotation required to move one vector to the other.

   2. [E] Given a vector , find vector of unit length such that the dot product of and is maximum.
   ```text
   To find the vector of unit length that maximizes the dot product with a given vector, you can simply normalize the given vector. Normalizing a vector means dividing it by its magnitude, so that the resulting vector has a magnitude of 1. This is done by dividing each component of the vector by the magnitude of the vector. If the given vector is X, the normalized vector would be: normalized vector = (1/magnitude of X) * X. 
   
   For example, if X is a two-dimensional vector with components (x1, x2), the normalized vector of X would be: normalized vector of X = (1/sqrt(x1^2 + x2^2)) * (x1, x2) 
   
   The dot product of the normalized vector with the original vector will be maximum, because the dot product is proportional to the magnitudes of the two vectors, and the normalized vector has a magnitude of 1. Alternatively, you can also find the unit vector that maximizes the dot product by projecting the given vector onto the unit vector and then normalizing the result. This will give you the same result as normalizing the given vector directly.
