# Company A Questions and Answers (beta)

### Machine Learning
1. Describe Supervised, unsupervised, semi supervised learning with examples.
2. How would you use a model trained with only a few examples that has not optimal scores in order to train an unsupervised model for a similar task?
3. Is accuracy a good measure to evaluate a binary classification model?
4. Let a dataset with thousands of features. How do you decide what feature to keep that are more useful when training a model?
5. Explain how SVM works.
6. Explain L1 and L2 regularization.
7. How can you avoid overfitting?
8. What is the purpose of the activation function?
9. Given 2 sets of inputs x and y calculate the output of relu and sigmoid activation function
10. Where should we use the sigmoid and where the relu activation functions 
11. Explain as detailed as possible the pipeline for training a text classification model (text pre-process, feature extraction , model selection , training process)
12. Let's say you need to create recommendation system for online ads for a sites users. The training dataset consists of user preference and labels data. Explain what type of model will you use and how will you train it?
13. Let's say that you want to train a Naive Bayes model as a baseline for the online ads recommendation system. How would you train a naive Bayes model if your data consist of millions of classes?
14. Why we call Naive Bayes "Naive"?
15. What if you wanted to group those users together based on there preference and how will this help build a recommendation model?

### Deep Learning
16. Why do we need multiple hidden layers? 
17. What to expect to happen when we add a very deep network of hundreds of layers in a neural network?
18. What to expect to happen when we add a very large input layer in a neural network?
19. What if we don't use any activation function in a deep neural network?
20. What are the pros and cons of using BiLSTM or RNN layers instead of deep MLP?
21. Explain what an Auto Encoder is

### Data Structures
21. What type of ds does python use for dictionaries?
22. What are the advantages of using a hash map?
23. What is the time complexity for searching for a value in array?

### Algorithms
24. Code a “find 2 values that sum up to a target in an array” program.
